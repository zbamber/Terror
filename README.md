# 🌍 Global Terrorism Visualiser

## 📊 Visualises Global Terrorism

If you want to know what it does… just [try it out](https://terror-three.vercel.app/) (or, you know, read the title).  

This was mainly a project to **learn web development** and see if I liked it. Spoiler: building stuff was fun, but configuring things… not so much 😅.  

The design isn’t overly creative, but thanks to shamelessly exploiting [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/), it looks reasonably smart. I also discovered [Globe.gl](https://globe.gl/) *after* mostly implementing the globe myself with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — turns out someone had already done it better. Classic.  

Despite the chaos, I had a great experience with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) (would recommend). Using **Svelte 5 runes** is cool, but be warned: every AI model is useless at writing it for you. Luckily the [Svelte docs](https://svelte.dev/docs) are excellent.  

This is also my **first medium-sized JavaScript project**, so yes: the code quality is probably awful. Yes: it’s fragile. No: I didn’t do much error handling. Please just use it the way I expected you to 🙏.

## 🤖 AI Disclaimer

This was my first web project using a proper framework, so I leaned on AI (ChatGPT, [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/)) to help me understand concepts. Almost none of the code was written directly by AI — it was mostly a learning tool.  

Also, this README? Formatted by AI. (Hi 👋)
